    <hr>
    <p>My Faourite person is Dr. APJ Abdul Kalam.He was born on 15th October 1931 in Rameshwaram,Tamil Nadu..His father
      Jainulabdeen Marakyar was a boat maker and his mother was housewife so his financial condition was not so good so
      that's why he also selled newspapers.In his school years, Kalam had average grades but he was an hard working
      student.After completing his education at the Schwartz Higher Secondary School, Ramanathapuram, Kalam went on to
      attend Saint Joseph's College, Tiruchirappalli, then affiliated with the University of Madras, from where he
      graduated in physics in 1954. He moved to Madras in 1955 to study aerospace engineering in Madras Institute of
      Technology.While Kalam was working on a senior class project, the Dean was dissatisfied with his lack of progress
      and threatened to revoke his scholarship unless the project was finished within the next three days. Kalam met the
      deadline, impressing the Dean. Kalam wanted to become fighter pilot but he didn't succeed as he placed ninth in
      qualifiers, and only eight positions were available in the IAF.Kalam served as the 11th president of India,
      succeeding K. R. Narayanan. He won the 2002 presidential election with an electoral vote of 922,884, surpassing
      the 107,366 votes won by Lakshmi Sahgal. His term lasted from 25 July 2002, to 25 July 2007.</p>
